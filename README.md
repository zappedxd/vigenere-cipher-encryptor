# Vigenère Cipher Encryptor

This project is a Python script that encrypts messages using the Vigenère cipher. The script prompts the user to input the plaintext and the keyword, and then it encrypts the message using the Vigenère cipher algorithm.

## Features

- **User Input**: Allows users to input the plaintext and the keyword directly in the terminal or via the web interface.
- **Encryption**: Encrypts the plaintext using the provided keyword.
- **Simple and Easy to Use**: The script is designed for ease of use, with straightforward input and output.

## New Update

In addition to the Python script, I have attached an `vigenere-cipher-encryptor.html` file that will perform the encryption process in a web browser. You can use this file to encrypt messages without running the Python script.

## How to Use

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/zappedxd/vigenere-cipher-encryptor.git
   ```
   Or download the files directly from the repository.

2. **Run the Python Script**:
   - Open a terminal and navigate to the directory where the script is located.
   - Run the script using Python:
     ```bash
     python encoder.py
     ```
   - If you are using Python 3, you may need to use:
     ```bash
     python3 encoder.py
     ```

3. **Or Use the HTML File**:
   - Open the `vigenere-cipher-encryptor.html` file in any web browser.
   - Input the plaintext and the keyword into the form fields.
   - The web page will display the encrypted message.

## Example

### Python Example:
```plaintext
Enter the plaintext to encrypt: ATTACKATDAWN
Enter the keyword: KEY
Encrypted: LXFOPVEFRNHR
```

### HTML Example:
Open `vigenere-cipher-encryptor.html` in a web browser, input the same text and keyword, and it will display the encrypted text.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x (for the script)
- A web browser (for the HTML file)
