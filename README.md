# Vigenère Cipher Encryptor

This project is a Python script that encrypts messages using the Vigenère cipher. The script prompts the user to input the plaintext and the keyword, and then it encrypts the message using the Vigenère cipher algorithm.

## Features

- **User Input**: Allows users to input the plaintext and the keyword directly in the terminal.
- **Encryption**: Encrypts the plaintext using the provided keyword.
- **Simple and Easy to Use**: The script is designed for ease of use, with straightforward input and output.

## How to Use

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/vigenere-cipher-encryptor.git
   ```
   Or download the script directly from the repository.

2. **Run the Script**:
   - Open a terminal and navigate to the directory where the script is located.
   - Run the script using Python:
     ```bash
     python vigenere_encryptor.py
     ```
   - If you are using Python 3, you may need to use:
     ```bash
     python3 vigenere_encryptor.py
     ```

3. **Input Your Plaintext and Keyword**:
   - Enter the plaintext that you want to encrypt.
   - Enter the keyword to use for the Vigenère cipher encryption.
   - The script will output the encrypted message in the terminal.

## Example
